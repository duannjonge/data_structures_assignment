# Project Description


## Question 1
Question 1: Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string 
containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets,and determines whether 
the expression is balanced.

An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing 
bracket in the correct order.

sample input = 

expression1 = "([]{})"
expression2 = "([)]"
print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False 

## Question 2

Question 2: Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a 
sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates 
removed while maintaining the original order of elements.
